Fraction Class and Driver Class
=============

This is a class project for Porter-Gaud's Applied Math class.

The following commands can be done in the FractionDrive class:

Fraction.add(Fraction) - 
  Adds 2 Fraction together.

Fraction.subtract(Fraction) - 
   Subtracts 2 Fractions.

Fraction.multiply(Fraction) - 
  Multiplies two fractions

Fraction.divide(Fraction) - 
  Divides 2 Fractions

Fraction.toString() - 
  Converts the Fraction to a string

Fraction.toDecimal() - 
  Converts the current fraction to a decimal

Fraction.toRecip() - 
  Takes the Reciprocal of 2 fractions

Fraction.reduce() - 
  Reduces the fractions

Fraction.gcd(int, int) - 
  Takes the GCD of 2 integers. This method is used with the reduce     method.
Fraction.lcd(int, int) - 
  Takes the lowest common denominator of 2 integers. Not used in any of the classes, but I wrote it and don't want to take it out...
